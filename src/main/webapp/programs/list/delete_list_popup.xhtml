                        This will also delete all subscriptions you have in this list. 
                        However, if a subscriber exist in this list and another list, eg. List B,
                        then deleting this list will not delete the subscriber from List B.

                    <p>
                        As size of lists can be huge, deleting a list can take some time.
                        We will mark your list as to-be-deleted, so that our scheduled background
                        jobs can delete it in the background while you work on other lists.
                        Once your list has been marked as to-be-deleted, it cannot be edited anymore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have scheduled any mails to be sent to this list before you click on 
                        "Confirm Delete", the sending will complete before this delete operation can
                        proceed. In order to stop sending scheduled mails, you should stop it using 
                        <a>SendMail</a>.
